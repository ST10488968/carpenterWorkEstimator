Brief Description
-------

The program/application in it's totality should be able to register a task being selected (RadioButton), given materal(s) needed (Checkbox) and hours entered by the user and the program should 
be able to calculate the estimated total cost by multiplying the cost of materias and the hours the user had previously input. As shown by the screenshots provided above, if these conditions are 
not met, the program/app will fail to execute and an appropriate message will display and help guide the user to fully use the program.
